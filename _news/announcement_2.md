After graduation, I moved to Cambridge, MA, and spent the summer of 2021 working as a Research Scientist intern at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Centre for Quantum Computing. As part of their Quantum Hardware team, I got to work on some very cool physics in service of the greater goal of building up Amazon's quantum computing research effort.
