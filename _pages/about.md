Hi! My name is Shoumik, and I'm an aspiring quantum physicist and engineer.

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in quantum engineering at MIT, where I work in the Engineering Quantum Systems group ([EQuS](https://equs.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}) with Prof. [Will Oliver](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/william-oliver/){:target="_blank"}. I'm broadly interested in experimental and applied theoretical quantum computing, and my specific current research directions include bosonic qubits, quantum error correction, Floquet theory, and nonlinear dynamics in superconducting circuits. My Ph.D. is generously [supported](https://physics.yale.edu/news/shoumik-chowdhury-yc2021-has-won-nsf-graduate-fellowship){:target="_blank"} by the National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship ([NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"}) and the MIT Jacobs Presidential Fellowship. 

Before grad school, I earned my bachelors degree in Mathematics and Physics from Yale University in 2021. At Yale, I pursued undergraduate research with Prof. [Liang Jiang](https://pme.uchicago.edu/group/jiang-group){:target="_blank"} on theoretical quantum transduction, and with Prof. [Michel Devoret](http://qulab.eng.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"} on multi-photon resonances in strongly-driven superconducting qubits. During this period, I also worked as a Quantum Engineer at [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com/){:target="_blank"}, and briefly as a Research Scientist at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing. Outside of research, I helped serve the larger physics community at Yale as co-president of the Yale Society of Physics Students ([SPS](https://spsyale.sites.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and as a founding board member of Yale Undergraduate Quantum Computing ([YuQC](https://yuqc.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}). You can find more details about my experiences and projects I've worked on in the **[`Projects`](projects)** section above!
