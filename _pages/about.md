Hi! My name is Shoumik, and I'm an aspiring quantum physicist and engineer.

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in quantum engineering at MIT, where I work in the Engineering Quantum System group ([EQuS](https://equs.mit.edu/)) with Prof. [Will Oliver](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/william-oliver/). While I am broadly interested in experimental and applied theoretical quantum information science, some specific current research directions include bosonic qubits, quantum error correction, and nonlinear dynamics in superconducting circuits. My work is generously supported by the [NSF](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) Graduate Fellowship and the MIT Jacobs Presidential Fellowship. 

Before grad school, I received a B.S. in Math and Physics from Yale in 2021. At Yale, I pursued undergraduate research with Prof. [Liang Jiang](https://pme.uchicago.edu/group/jiang-group) on theoretical quantum transduction, and Prof. [Michel Devoret](http://qulab.eng.yale.edu/) on the nonlinear dynamics of strongly-driven superconducting qubits. During this period, I also worked as a Quantum Engineer at [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com/), and as Research Scientist intern at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Centre for Quantum Computing. Outside of research, I helped serve the larger physics community at Yale as co-president of the [Yale Society of Physics Students (SPS)](https://spsyale.sites.yale.edu/) and as a founding board member of Yale Undergraduate Quantum Computing ([YuQC](https://yaleqc.com/)). You can find more details about my experiences and projects I've worked on in the **[`Projects`](projects)** section above!
