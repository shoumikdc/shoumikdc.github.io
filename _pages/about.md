Hello! My name is Shoumik and I'm a first-year PhD student in quantum engineering at MIT. I am broadly interested in experimental and applied theoretical quantum information science, and currently work in the MIT Engineering Quantum Systems ([EQuS](https://equs.mit.edu/)) group, with Prof. Will Oliver. My work is supported by the NSF Graduate Fellowship and the MIT Jacobs Presidential Fellowship.

This summer I be working as a Research Scientist intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS), at the AWS-Caltech Centre for Quantum Computing.

I previously received a B.S. in Mathematics and Physics at Yale University, where I was fortunate to do research with Profs. Michel Devoret, Liang Jiang, and David Moore. As an undergraduate, I also spent a year at [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com/) as a Junior Quantum Engineer.

<b>Undergraduates at McGill:</b>
I welcome these emails, but they should include a CV, research interests, list of relevant course work, a transcript, and your programming experience. The subject line should contain the word "consideration for undergraduate research project" to indicate these instructions have been read.
