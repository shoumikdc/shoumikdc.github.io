Hello! I'm Shoumik, a first-year PhD student in quantum engineering at MIT. I am broadly interested in experimental and applied theoretical quantum information science, and currently work in the MIT Engineering Quantum Systems (**[EQuS](https://equs.mit.edu/)**) group, with Prof. Will Oliver. My work is supported by the NSF Graduate Fellowship and the MIT Jacobs Presidential Fellowship.

This summer I will be working as a Research Scientist intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS), as part of the AWS-Caltech Centre for Quantum Computing.

I previously received a B.S. in Mathematics and Physics at Yale University, where I was fortunate to do research with Profs. Michel Devoret, Liang Jiang, and David Moore. As an undergraduate, I also spent a year at **[Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com/)** as a Junior Quantum Engineer.
