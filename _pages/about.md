Hello! I'm Shoumik, a first-year Ph.D. student in quantum engineering at MIT. I am broadly interested in experimental and applied theoretical quantum information science, and currently work as a graduate research fellow in the MIT Engineering Quantum Systems ([EQuS](https://equs.mit.edu/)) group, with Prof. Will Oliver. My research is generously supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship ([NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)), and the MIT Jacobs Presidential Fellowship.

Before coming to MIT, I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Physics from Yale University in 2021. At Yale, I was fortunate to carry out undergraduate research with Prof. [Liang Jiang](https://pme.uchicago.edu/group/jiang-group) on theoretical quantum transduction, and Prof. [Michel Devoret](http://qulab.eng.yale.edu/) on the nonlinear dynamics of strongly-driven superconducting qubits. During this period, I also spent time working as a Quantum Engineer at [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com/), and as Research Scientist intern at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Centre for Quantum Computing. You can find more details about these experiences and the projects I worked on in the **[`CV`](cv)** and **[`Projects`](projects)** sections above!
