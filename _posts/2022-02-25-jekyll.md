This website is built using **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** and hosted on **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**. Jekyll is a so-called Ruby Gem --- i.e. built on top of the Ruby language, and uses a combination of Markdown, HTML/CSS, and Javascript to run. 

When deciding to set up a personal website, I considered several options beyond Jekyll: e.g. **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**, **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)**, bare HTML/CSS, and WYSIWYG editors like Wix or Squarespace. Ultimately, I decided to go with Jekyll for its easy integrate with Github Pages, and because I liked the **[al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)** theme. I found the Jekyll/Github workflow to be relatively simple to set up, and so hope that this quick guide can be helpful for anyone wishing to quickly set up a website!


## Installing Ruby and Jekyll
See additional instructions [here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-ruby-on-ubuntu-20-04/). 

The first thing we need to do is to install Ruby. From the **[official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)**, this can be done via **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)**. However, if you're like me, and use `conda` as your main package manager, it turns out to be somewhat thorny to get `conda` and `brew` to work together on a Mac. I decided to avoid Homebrew altogether for this reason.

#### Rbenv Setup
Instead, I used `rbenv`: a lightweight command-line tool for installing and managing Ruby versions. More details can be found in the guide above, and in the **[`rbenv` documentation](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation)**. 

1. Get the `rbenv` installer shell script and run:
 ```bash
 $ curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
 ```
This clones `rbenv` and `ruby-build` from Github into the folder `./rbenv`. 
2. Add `~/.rbenv/bin` to the system `PATH`:
* Basically, allowing your system to recognize `rbenv` as a command. For Mac (zsh):
```bash
$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
3. Initialize `rbenv`:
* Run the following two lines and then restart terminal for changes to take effect:
```bash
$ ~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init
$ eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"
```
4. Check installation using script:
```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/main/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
```

#### Ruby Setup
One that's done, Ruby can be installed via:
```bash
$ rbenv install -l # list latest stable versions
$ rbenv install 2.7.5 # install a particular version
$ rbenv global 2.7.5  # set that particular version as the main one
``` 

#### Jekyll Setup
Finally, we can install Jekyll and Bundler (for Gems): {% highlight bash %} $ gem install jekyll bundler {% endhighlight %}{: .inlined }

## Setting up a Local Server

Starting with a Jekyll template on Github, you can clone into the repo and get it set up via:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
